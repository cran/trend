  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The references and description 
      in the .Rd file for the function \code{rrod.test} 
      was extended in order to address the 
      original authors Fligner and Pollicello.

\section{CHANGES IN TREND VERSION 1.1.0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The function \code{lanzante.test} for performing
      a non-parametric single-change point-detection test
      using either the \code{wilcox.test} or the
      robust rank order distribution test (\code{rrod.test})
      was added.
      \item The function \code{rrod.test} for performing
      the non-parametric robust rank order distribution test
      was added.

\section{CHANGES IN TREND VERSION 1.0.1}{
  \subsection{MODIFICATION}{
    \itemize{
      \item The internal function \code{.mkScore} was slightly
      recoded to enhance speed. Thanks to Martin Schmelzer.

\section{CHANGES IN TREND VERSION 1.0.0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The function \code{bartels.test} for performing the rank
      version of von Neumann's ratio test was added.
      \item The function \code{br.test} for performing the
      Buishand range test was added.
      \item The function \code{bu.test} for performing the
      Buishand U test was added.
      \item The function \code{snh.test} for performing Alexandersson's
      standard normal homogeinity test was added.
      \item The generic function \code{plot.cptest} was added
      to plot the output of the above functions.
      \item The function \code{pettitt.test} was recoded in order to
      increase speed.
      \item The functions \code{mk.test}, \code{smk.test},
      \code{cmk.test}, \code{partial.mk.test} and \code{sens.slope}
      were recoded
      in order to increase speed. They consistently produce output
      objects of class \code{"htest"}.
      \item The generic function \code{summary.smktest} was added
      to display seasonal output of \code{smk.test}
      \item The function \code{sea.sens.slope} was recoded and
      produces a scalar output.
      \item The function \code{mult.mk.test} was added for multiside
      or multivariate Mann-Kendall Test.
      \item The \code{man} pages were revisited and now contain
      the underlying mathematical functions.
